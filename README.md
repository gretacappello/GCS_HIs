This repository is based on the GCS in Python repository (https://github.com/johan12345/gcs_python).
Install gcs_python using the steps described there. 
Afterwards, you can open and run my notebook gcs_CORs_HIs.ipynb to overplot the GCS mesh onto coronagraphs and heliospheric imager data. In the example notebook we provide the GCS reconstruction on WISPR-I and SoloHI-tile 2 data for a CME event studied by Liberatore et al. 2025 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...983...82L/abstract).
